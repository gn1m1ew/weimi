  <h4> What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them? </h4>
  <p> The problem I met was I didn't know how to create a new file in the repository </p>
  <p> Before I solve it, I read the guide of the github and learn how to create the new file. </p>
  <p> Then because this is my first time to write the code of html, I read the introduction of how to write html code and use the format to write. </p>
  <h4> What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know? </h4>
  <p> I have learned how to create the file in the repository </p>
  <p> I have learned how to write the easy code of html and add some words(size of title and para) and images in it. </p>
  <p> I have learned how to move the file into the local repository or github use ssh key. </p>
  <h4> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources? </h4>
  <p> I think piazza and web source are most helpful for completing the html assignment. Because I can search some guides of writing code. </p>
  <p> Piazza can let me ask more questions and share the experience of completing assignment (such as about the github and html code). Someone who has the same questions can know how to solve it. </p>
